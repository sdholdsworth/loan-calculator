This project consititues a single page interactive loan calculator application, where the user can key in the amount they want to borrow, the applicable interest rate and the number of years they wish to pay off a desired loan for. The loan calculator will then calculate and return the monthly repayment cost, the total repayment cost and the total interest in this relatively basic, yet slick, stylish and simplistic UI.
